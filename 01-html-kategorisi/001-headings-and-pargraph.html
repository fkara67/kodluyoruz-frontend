<h2>Languages That I love</h2>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is a popular programming language known for its portability and versatility.<br>
    Java programs are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),<br>
    allowing them to run on different platforms.
    Java's object-oriented nature and extensive libraries<br>
    make it suitable for a wide range of software development tasks.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>
    JavaScript is a scripting language commonly used for web development to add interactivity to websites.<br>
    It runs in web browsers, enabling dynamic updates and real-time interactions without requiring page reloads.<br>
    With its widespread adoption, JavaScript has become an essential skill for front-end and full-stack developers.
